# When using imgpkg push/pull, it does not preserve permissions for groups and
# other and instead only keeps user permissions. This will break workshops where
# files are being used with docker builds and things will only work where
# original permissions exist. To try and avoid problems, if we see that only
# owner permissions exist, copy those to group and others. There is still a risk
# that a source file may not have actually had group or other permissions and so
# that is desired, but not likely and nothing else that can be done. Also note
# that we don't fail if there are problems. In particular, if a volume mount was
# used to add files, the directories will not be writable so we want to avoid a
# hard failure in that case.
