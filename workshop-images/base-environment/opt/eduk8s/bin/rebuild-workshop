# Run workshop specific setup scripts and then source the corresponding profile
# scripts as well so they are available for later setup scripts. Note that this
# script will be executed inline to the start-container script. In that case
# errors in the profile scripts can cause the workshop container to not start.
# Since we cannot capture what happens in profile scripts into the log file in
# that case, and because the container will not actually start anyway, it is
# necessary to look at the container log file instead. An error in setup scripts
# on the other hand shouldn't usually cause the container to not start and the
# log can be consulted from within the workshop session container.
